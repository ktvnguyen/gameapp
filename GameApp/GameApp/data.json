  "Rules": "How to Set Up Speed: Shuffle cards thoroughly. Place two stacks of four cards face-down in the center, far enough apart that it will allow for two discard piles and flailing hands. Then dispense the rest of the cards one-by-one between the two players.\n\nObject of Speed: To be the fastest person, getting rid of your pile first.\n\nHow to Play Speed\n\nBoth players draw four cards from their personal draw piles. Throughout the game they may have up to four cards in their hand at any given time, but no more than four.\nOnce both players are ready, they each place their right hand on the right stack of cards in the center. When the dealer says, \"Go,\" they flip the top card over face-up onto a discard pile in the center, forming two discard piles.\nBoth players. as quickly as they can, discard the cards in their hand onto either discard pile going numerically up or down. Suit and color do not matter. They may grab additional cards from their stack at any time as long as they do not exceed four cards. The game proceeds until there are no more plays or a player runs out of cards.\nIf there are no more plays and both players have four cards in their hand, then they each place their right hand on the right deck. The dealer says, \"Go,\" and each player flips the top card over onto the discard pile. Play continues like this until a player runs out of cards, in which case the first one out is the winner!\nSide Note: Aces can go on either a two or a King, and vice versa. Color and suit does not matter. If two players place the same card down, whoever's hand is on the bottom leaves their card, the other opponent must keep the card in their hand. Be careful, injuries have occurred."

  "Rules": "Two people alternate saying a letter, and together, they begin to spell a word. The key is that you have to be working towards a real word (proper nouns and weird Scrabble words don�t count), but you can�t complete a word, or you lose. One key rule is that, at least the way I play, two and three-letter words don�t count, so the first three moves are �safe� and only on the fourth move can someone lose by completing a word. So a simple example:\n\nPlayer 1: S\nPlayer 2: Q\nPlayer 1: U\nPlayer 2: A\nPlayer 1: S\nPlayer 2: Is fucked. The only playable letter is H, and that completes a word.\n\nWhen a player loses a round, they get a �G.� Then you play again (alternating which player says the first letter). When a player loses for the second time, they get an �H.� And so on, and the first person to get a G-H-O-S-T loses the game and the other player is the winner.\n\nAnother rule is that if one player doesn�t think that the last letter played by the other player creates any possible words�i.e. he doesn�t believe they�re working toward a real word anymore, he can �challenge.� When you challenge, the other player has to be able to say a real word they�re working towards. If she can, she wins the round and the challenger loses. If she can�t, she loses and the challenger wins the round. So for example:\n\nPlayer 1: S\nPlayer 2: Q\nPlayer 1: U\nPlayer 2: A\nPlayer 1: G\nPlayer 2: Challenge\nPlayer 1: Squaggly\nPlayer 2: Not a word. You lose."

  "Rules": "How to play 13\n\nKnowing the rank of cards:\n\nFrom lowest to highest, the ranking is:  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2.  The 2 is the most powerful card in the game.  Suits also have rank in this game.  From lowest to highest, the ranking is spades _, clubs _, diamonds _, and then hearts _ is the highest suit.  So the 3 of spades is the lowest single card in the game, while the 2 of hearts is the highest ranked.\n\nDealing: Deal evenly so each player has 13 total cards.  If you are playing with more or less than 4 players, just make sure each player has the same amount of cards.\n\nThe 5 types of plays:\n\nSingle:  one card (ex: 7_)\n\nPair:  two cards with the same value  (ex: 8_, 8_)\n\nTriple:  three cards with the same value (ex: J_, J_, J_)\n\nRun (straight):  three or more cards that are in a sequence  (ex: 10_, J_, Q_, K_)\n\nBomb:  A bomb can be played on any of your turns.  It will end that round and allow you to begin the next round (unless someone plays a higher-valued bomb on top of yours).  A four of a kind is the highest-valued bomb (ex: 5_,5_,5_,5_).  Another type of bomb is pair sequence of the same color (ex: Q_, Q_, K_, K_, A_, A_).  The more cards involved in the pair sequence, the higher in value it is (ex: 3_, 3_, 4_, 4_, 5_, 5_, 6_, 6_, is worth more than a 10_, 10_, J_, J_, Q_, Q_).\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe player who was dealt the 3 of spades begins the game.  They can start the game using any type of play as long as it involves the 3 of spades.  (so they can start with a single, run, pair, etc�)\nFrom there, the turns go in a clockwise fashion.\nIf it is your turn, you can decide if you want to play or pass.\nIf you pass, you can�t play again until all other players have passed and that round is over (you must pass if you can�t lay down a hand with a higher value).\nIn order to play, you must be able to lay down a hand that has a higher value than the hand just laid down by the previous player, but it has to be the same type of hand (unless you are dropping a bomb).  In other words, if the round begins with a pair, you can only play pairs until that round is over (with exception to bombs).\nThe round is over once all the players pass.\nThe player that ended the round gets to begin the new round by playing anything he/she wants.\nThe player who gets rid of all their cards first, wins.  The others can continue to play for 2nd, 3rd, and so on.\nInstant-Win: A player wins instantly if he/she is dealt all four 2s or a dragon (3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A,2)"

  "Rules": "Objective: Collect all the cards.\n\nRules:\n\nHave everyone sit in a circle around a table or on the floor. Deal clockwise until you run out of cards. Everyone holds their cards facedown without looking at them.\nGoing around the circle, each player draws a card from the top of their deck (face-out, so that the player cannot see the card before it is played) and places that card in the center of the circle. Each player continues to place their cards in the center this way.\nWhen a Jack court card is turned face up, the goal is to be the first person to �slap� it, or cover it with your hand. If several people slap at once, the person whose hand is most in contact with the Jack adds all the cards to his or her pile.\nIf a player incorrectly slaps a card, he or she must give the top card in his or her pile to the player who placed the slapped card. That player adds the extra card to the bottom of his or her deck.\nWhen a player runs out of cards, the player is out�unless he or she can slap a Jack laid by someone else. At that point, the previously �out� player is back in and can play with the cards collected from the pile.\nPlay continues until one person wins all of the cards. For a shorter version, stop play when the first person runs out of cards.

  "Rules": "The Deal\nDeal cards one at a time face down, to each player until all the cards have been dealt evenly. Without looking at any of the cards, each player squares up his hand into a neat pile in front of him.\n\nThe Play\nStarting to the left of the dealer players pull the top card off their pile and place it face-up in the middle. If the card played is a number card, the next player puts down a card, too. This continues around the table until somebody puts down a face card or an Ace (J, Q, K, or A).\n\nWhen a face card or an ace is played, the next person in the sequence must play another face card or an ace in order for play to continue.\n\nIf the next person in the sequence does not play a face card or an ace within their allotted chance, the person who played the last face card or an ace wins the round and the whole pile goes to them. The winner begins the next round of play.\n\nThe only thing that overrides the face card or an ace rule is the slap rule. The first person to slap the pile of cards when the slap rule is put into effect is the winner of that round. If it cannot be determined who was the first to slap the pile, the person with the most fingers on top wins.\n\nSlap Rules\nDouble � When two cards of equivalent value are laid down consecutively. Ex: 5, 5\nSandwich � When two cards of equivalent value are laid down consecutively, but with one card of different value between them. Ex: 5, 7, 5\nTop Bottom � When the same card as the first card of the set is laid down.\nTens � When two cards played consecutively (or with a letter card in between) add up to 10. For this rule, an ace counts as one. Ex: 3, 7 or A, K, 9\nJokers � When jokers are used in the game, which should be determined before gameplay begins. Anytime someone lays down a joker, the pile can be slapped.\nFour in a row � When four cards with values in consistent ascending or descending order is placed. Ex: 5, 6, 7, 8 or Q, K, A, 2\nMarriage � When a queen is placed over or under a king. Ex: Q, K or K,Q\n\nYou must add one or two cards to the bottom of the pile if you slap the pile when it was not slappable.\n\nContinue playing even if you have run out of cards. As long as you don't slap at the wrong time, you are still allowed to \"slap in\" and get cards! Everyone should try to stay in the game until you have a single winner who obtains all the cards\n\nHow to Keep Score\nThe player, who has all of the cards at the end of the game, wins.\n\n- See more at: http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/egyptian-rat-screw/#sthash.WiuixOZK.dpuf"

  "Rules": "Introduction\n\nCandyman, also known as Drug Dealer, is a game in which playing-cards are used to assign secret roles to the players.\n\nAt least 4 players are needed and the game works best with 6 or more.\n\nSetup\n\nFrom a standard 52-card pack take one Ace, one King and enough numeral cards (2-10) so that you have the same number of cards as there are players. These cards are shuffled and each player draws one card and looks at it, without showing it to any other player.\n\nThe player who draws the Ace is the Candyman (or Drug Dealer).\nThe player who draws the King is the Cop (Police).\nAll the other players, who draw numeral cards, are Buyers (or Users).\nPlay and Objectives\n\nThe Candyman's aim is to sell candy to as many buyers as possible without being caught by the Cop. To sell candy, the Candyman makes eye contact with a buyer and winks at him or her. No player other than the Candyman is allowed to wink.\n\nThe Buyers' aim is to buy candy. The difficulty is that they do not initially know which of the other players is the Candyman. When a Buyer succeeds in buying candy by being winked at by the Candyman, the Buyer reveals his or her card, says \"Sold!\" (or \"The deal has been made!\") and retires from the game. The Buyer must not reveal who the Candyman is.\n\nThe Cop's aim is to identify and expose the Candyman as soon as possible, and at any rate before all the Buyers can buy candy. When the Cop thinks that he or she knows who is selling candy, the Cop can make an accusation, saying \"busted\" and naming and pointing at the accused player. This player must expose his or her card. If the accused player is really the Candyman, the round ends. If the accused player is a Buyer, the round continues. The Cop can make further accusations, although this may become more difficult, since after the first accusation everyone knows who the Cop is.\n\nIf your group of players finds winking inconvenient, you may agree to use some other sign for dealing, such as tapping your face.\n\nScoring\n\nThe game can be played without keeping score, but Bonnie Fishell's description included the following method of scoring, which reflects the aims of the players.\n\nCandyman: +1 point for each successful deal, -2 points if busted.\nBuyer: +1 point for buying candy or if wrongly accused by the cop. No points otherwise.\nCop: -1 point for each incorrect accusation, +2 points for a correct accusation.\nPoints can be added up from round to round, and the game continues for 15 rounds, or until a player has 21 or more points, or the players can agree some other ending condition."

  "Game": "Mafia",
  "Rules": "THE OBJECTIVE\n\nSimply put, the objective of the game is for the mafia to �kill off� civilians until they are the majority or the civilians to kill off the entire mafia. When one of those two things happens, the game is over.\n\nFor the sake of example, let�s say you have a group of 13 people in your living room. Roles must be assigned to each person in secret. There will be 3 mafia, 1 detective, 1 doctor, 1 narrator, and 8 civilians. Great, now everyone has a role. Be sure they are all kept under wraps. Do not tell anyone your identity. The game itself is divided into two phases: Day and Night. During the night, everyone keeps his or her eyes closed until the narrator awakens each role beginning with the mafia, then the doctor, then the detective. But who are each of these roles and what do they do? So glad you asked.\n\nTHE ROLES\n\nThe Narrator keeps time rolling. They do not officially participate in the game, but act as a moderator. During the night, when all players have their eyes closed, the narrator awakens each role and asks them a question. For the mafia, the question is: Who do you want to kill? For the doctor: Who do you want to save? For the detective: Who do you want to know about? During the day, when everyone is awake, the narrator prompts players to nominate those they�d like to kill a.k.a. those they think are in the mafia. The game repeats in phases from night to day, night to day, with one person murdered in each phase (except if they are saved at night by the doctor).\n\nThe Mafia, as per our 13-person example, consists of 3 people who find out each other�s identity in the first nighttime phase. While the other players are attempting to figure out who they are, the mafia must lie the entire game and act as though they are civilians. This is, in my opinion, the hardest role as anyone who knows you might be able to tell you are lying. The mafia must strategize together during the day without giving themselves away. At night, when the mafia awaken, they point silently to the player theyd like to kill. If all mafia agree, the player is offed.\n\nThe Civilians are attempting to figure out who is in the mafia simply by talking it out, accusing, and seeing who is acting suspicious. As a civilian, its best to use verbal/non-verbal cues and your gut to make alliances.\n\nThe Doctor is a civilian role that, at each nighttime phase, can save a player he or she thinks the mafia has killed. As mentioned earlier, if the doctor saves the right player, that player is brought back into the game. The doctor cannot save themselves.\n\nThe Detective is a civilian role that, at each nighttime phase, can point to a player he or she thinks is in the mafia and the narrator will nod their head yes or no. This role is perhaps the most fun, because once the detective begins to find out the identities of players, they can begin to make alliances with true civilians and or persuade the group to kill true mafia.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nFirst Night: The narrator begins at night by telling all players to close their eyes. Mafia, wake up. See your fellow members,� she says. Mafia, go to sleep. In the first round, this is all that happens.\n\nFirst Day: Everyone opens their eyes and the games begin. You must just start accusing people out of nowhere. Who is acting shyer than usual? Who is talking a bit too much? Ask straight-forward questions about identities. Look people directly in the eye and ask them if they are in the mafia. Once a nomination to kill is made, someone must second it for the player to be seriously considered in the mafia. If you have two solid nominations, all players then vote to kill, majority wins. You can have as many nominations as you want, but you need a majority to kill. When a player is killed, they are no longer allowed to speak and their identity is not revealed.\n\nSecond Night: All players eyes are closed and the narrator awakens the mafia and asks who they want to kill. She then awakens the doctor for the first time and asks who they want to save. And then, she awakens the detective and asks who they want to know about.\n\nThird Day: The narrator awakens all players and someone has been killed, unless the doctor has figured out who the mafia had their sights on and saved this player. The game continues in these phases, day and night, day and night, until civilians kill all mafia members or mafia outnumber civilians."
